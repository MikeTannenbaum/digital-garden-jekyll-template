[[Sensemaking is the process of creating situational awareness amid uncertain and ambiguous situations and anticipating trajectories in order to effectively make decisions]]

[[Wayfinding is the process of orienting within new environments, navigating through space, and progressing towards desired destinations]]

Building capacity in both areas increases the likelihood of successful outcomes for those attempting to adapt and evolve to meet the changing needs and pressures of markets and workforces. For individuals, teams, and organizations, building these skills improves people’s ability to learn, which improves their ability to create the positive outcomes they’re working towards, whatever they may be.

Effective sensemaking and wayfinding are dependent on having strong foundational capabilities like flexibility, agility, and continuous improvement. As information is discovered and knowledge is built, short learning cycles enable faster iteration which increases the likelihood of success.

Contexts and needs are always shifting and evolving, sometimes overnight, so building capacity for rapid iteration and adaptation to the way teams operate is crucial for organizations to effectively navigate unforeseen situations such as what we’re living through right now in 2020.

For the independent professional, sensemaking and wayfinding are crucial skills for finding markets to serve, evolving service offerings, and creating opportunities out of thin air.
