title: Knowledge teams need a shared digital space
---
Specifically, knowledge teams need a designed space purpose-fit for the unique needs of the team.

A space where people can see messy work and incomplete thoughts while discussing materials, ideas, and possibilities. An easy, intuitive, and accessible place where knowledge is cataloged, information is abundant, and communication is frequent.

For most teams, this does not exist. And it's not for lack of digital tools.

Most teams use ad hoc and rogue setups to communicate—and do a rather poor job.

Collaboration requires highly effective communication, and as a team rooted in knowledge work, it's important to be clear about *how we're going to work together*, so everyone is in agreement on the ways information is going to be passed back and forth.

Becoming optimized for distributed work means being able to collaborate asynchronously without the need for real-time knowledge transfers and meetings. This takes intention, organization, and frequent alignment of the team.

For an organization to be remote-optimized, their culture must also include informal opportunities for relationship building, career pathing, and mentoring, along with general team shenanigans that happen frequently and asynchronously.

Documentation of all meaningful activity creates opportunity for people to build ideas together. Connecting and building ideas can only happen when ideas are out there in the open for people to react to, challenge, and build upon.

It’s the same as [[Learn in public]], really, just focused on a group of people instead of just the individual.
