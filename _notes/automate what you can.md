title: automate what you can
---
We have the tools available to free our minds of repetitive tasks by automating them, so we might as well enjoy the benefits of technological innovation.

My house has automated lighting sequences based on whether the house is occupied or not.

My laptop has text expanders that automates repetitive typing like snippets, templates, and frequent phrases with the click of a few keys.

[[Raycast is for automation and central control]], and enables many of my automations from one seamless workflow.

For example, by connecting Alfred with Obsidian, Evernote, and Notion, I'm able to search across most of [[my digital ecosystem]] from any screen by opening Alfred with ⌘⇧␣ and typing my query.

Automating frees the mind and helps us move towards a [[Mind like water]] state.
