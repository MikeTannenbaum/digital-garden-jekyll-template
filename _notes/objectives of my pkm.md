# Tools, Notes, and Sanity

> #on/PKM is what I use to build a body of knowledge

With so many tools available, I've realized that the writing experience of an app is not as much of a priority as I initially thought, when it comes to how I'm now approaching personal knowledge management. There are plenty of apps that make writing beautiful, intuitive, and feature-rich. Instead, I'm after the ability to organize, recall, discover, and work with information in the best ways possible.

It's this realization that guides my current choices for digital tooling.

## My PKM Objectives: Here's what I want to achieve with my PKM

To further inform how I design my system, I've written down [[how I use digital tools]], to help make sure I'm meeting my needs intentionally, and not letting things slip through.
