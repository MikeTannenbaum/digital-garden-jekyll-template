title: asynchronous communication is a critical component of the future of work
---
The more I observe organizations struggling to work effectively while distributed the more I realize the future isn‚Äôt about ‚Äú[[remote work]]‚Äù so much as ‚Äúasynchronous work.‚Äù

That includes converging and diverging, as obviously there are times when our best work is done together in real-time.

## Asynchronous (async) work requires:    
- Strong communication skills
- High levels of trust
- Ability to write effectively
- Continuous reflection and iteration
- Cadence and rhythm of interaction
- Frequent alignment check-ins
- Proper tooling and processes
- Clear and continuously renegotiated boundaries

These skills are increasingly essential for high-performing teams of knowledge workers, where efficiency and effectiveness are (read: should be) top of mind for everyone working as a part of the team. Since [[working efficiently means producing the desired results with minimal wasted effort or resources]], it's imperative to practice and learn how to effectively work efficiently‚Äîand asynchronous work enables this.

## Async work helps you and your teams:
- Reduce dependency on meetings
- Reclaim valuable time
- Cultivate less chaotic environments
- Facilitate more effective decision making
- Easily document knowledge, processes, and solutions
- Be free of constant scheduling and coordinating
- Cultivate more inclusive work cultures
- Have time to prepare your best thoughts, ideas, and responses

> *üõë  **What's this?** ‚úçÔ∏è  This whole note is a work in progress, but the below part is really rough. So why's it here? [[Share ideas before they‚Äôre ready]].*

[[A knowledge worker‚Äôs toolkit needs to be well-rounded]], and an increasingly essential part of this toolkit is the ability to work and communicate asynchronously.

[[think in terms of inputs and outputs to design better processes]].

Slack (or Microsoft Teams, or similar) should be used primarily for <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/informal-communication/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">informal communication</a>. If you are accustomed to Slack being an always-on center of urgency in a prior organization, breaking your reliance on it as a core part of accomplishing tasks will require deliberate effort and reinforcement.
