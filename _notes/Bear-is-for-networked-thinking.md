title: Bear is for networked thinking
---
Do not think of Bear as a note taking app. It is so much more.

Bear is the place where a few keystrokes can turn into unimaginable opportunities. It is an enabler of free flow thinking without constraints and limitations. Itâ€™s flexible enough for all notes to be linked to one another and connected via tags, yet structured enough that exploring those tags is manageable.

Networked thinking is a much better representation of how the mind actually works than linear thinking.

Improve your writing is thinking workflow by using a text expander to [[automate what you can]].
