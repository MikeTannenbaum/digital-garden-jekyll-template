title: My new system design
---

Ever since I was a kid I’ve had a fascination with systems, networks, and automation. When I was in my 10’s I bought all the hardware and software I could afford and spent my time putting them together in ways that would solve whatever problem I was facing at that time.

Fast forward to present day and I’m still a systems nerd perpetually iterating on my personal systems for writing, working, and managing digital data.

Somehow I ended up stumbling upon a community of folks passionate about building their own personal wikis, productivity systems, and digital gardens. Immediately I was hooked.

After much experimentation and exploration of new tools, I’ve improved my system tremendously *without adding any new tools*!

OK ok, I added one. But that’s because it’s an incredible tool with so much impact and potential I just had to give them my money. It’s called [Readwise](https://readwise.io) and I’ll write more about it in the future.

## Here’s what I’m working with right now
While a big part of this system is to facilitate writing, it’s important to remember that [[It’s not a writing system, it’s a thinking system whose byproduct is writing]].

* [[Drafts is for immediate note capture and works in progress]]
* [[Bear is for networked thinking]].
* Ulysses is for longer form writing.
* Day One is for journals and notebooks.
* [[Evernote is for outsourced memory]].
* Readwise is for serendipity and delight.
* Things is for getting shit done.
* [[Alfred is for automation and central control]].

Every one of those can be linked to from any other of those.

How amazing would it be to see all the multidirectional links across apps?

Each app serves a discrete and distinguishing purpose within the flow.

[[Bidirectional links between apps would greatly improve interoperability of concepts and ideas]]
