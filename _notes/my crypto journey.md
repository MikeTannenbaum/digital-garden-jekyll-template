title: my crypto journey
---

I traded bitcoin back in 2013 and sold everything for profit and now we're here ðŸ˜­

Been watching crypto since then and started filling some bags in 2019.

I've joined the latest NFT surge in October 2021 and am trying to figure out what's going on while also wanting to learn more about DAOs and ways of coordinating people.

I wrote about [[Bitcoin energy usage]] a while back and hope to document my web3 explorations and learnings as I go. So far I've done poorly at that because the space moves so fast and I'm either with family, at work, or in the cryptoverse. Hopefully I'll full up The Refined Mind with more web3 and crypto thinking, as it's a fascinating moment in history both of humans and of technology.

As of December I've been gathering and sorting resources via [this note](https://mikeyt.xyz/web3) â€” it's my workspace for collecting and processing links and resources along my crypto journey. Until I create knowledge on The Refined Mind, [this note](https://mikeyt.xyz/web3) will be your best resource to learn what I'm learning about web3.
