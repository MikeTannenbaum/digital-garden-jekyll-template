First ideas are rarely your best ideas.

In fact, there’s typically a long stream of garbage-y ideas spewing out first before the gold begins to emerge.

That’s why it’s important to [[just start writing]] and let all the sludge clear itself out. You’ve got to work through it! Both in the moment when you’re sitting and writing, and over time as you work to refine your ideas.

### Some tips on refining ideas:

Be consistent.

Create a system to help you think and process your ideas.

Use it to generate [[novel ideas]] and [[build a body of work]] that compounds over time.

Consistently [[stack the bricks]].

Think long term, play infinite games, and [[build a body of work]].
