title: evolution of the ecosystem

> This note is a quick overview of how I got to [[my digital ecosystem]] after documenting [[what I need in a digital workspace]].

Originally, Ulysses was for long form writing, Bear was for notes, and Things was for tasks.

Then I learned about how [[Tools for managing information overload and improving how we think are on the rise]] and have been experimenting with all the newcomers to the space.

In early 2020, I started experimenting with Roam Research to see how it might fit with my brain. I was stunned. Immediately I saw the potential of this brilliantly simple-yet-powerful piece of software. Though turns out, it wasn't the best at what it did — it just paved the way for all the new Tools for Thought.

Originally I thought [[Bear is for networked thinking]], but when I started [[Tinkering with Roam Research]], I quickly saw how it might actually end up replacing most of my personal stack.

I experimented with streamlining into Craft and Things, though recently have decided [[Notion is my workspace]] now, as it's wonderful at structuring knowledge, data, and information, while meeting [[what I need in a digital workspace]].

Now, [[my digital ecosystem]] is focused on key apps that handle 95% of my work: Drafts, Obsidian, Notion, Things

Others come in from time to time, as [[A knowledge worker’s toolkit needs to be well-rounded]], but I've been working to simplify, so here we are.
