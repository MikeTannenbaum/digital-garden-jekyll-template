title: what I need in a digital workspace
---
> As of July 2021 [I've joined the team](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-new-career-adventure-addressing-systems-change-our-mike-tannenbaum/) at [The Recycling Partnership](https://recyclingpartnership.org) as their [Director of Organizational Effectiveness](https://linkedin.com/in/tannenbaum). **Everything you read below is out of date** and applies to my life before joining The Partnership. 
> 
> What I'm realizing right now, on Wednesday, August 18, 2021, is that my entire personal [[digital ecosystem]] needs to evolve to meet my new needs. I've been self-employed for ~6 years, working with dozens of teams in dozens of tools, but mostly with my own software stack. Now my personal work is so intertwined with...my job's work...that I need new ways of working *for myself*. 
> 
> Specifically, I need to design a system for both myself and my team, individually as well as in intertwined. As I onboard myself to my new role, and build situational awareness, I'll consistently iterate and refine both systems until I find what works best.

[[I want somewhere to be My Workspace™]], and I want that somewhere to have what I consider critical capabilities for me:
- Bidirectional links
- Block references
- Fast search
- Fast sync
- Seamless mobile experience 
- Private, Secure, Offline
- Daily Notes
- Unlinked references *
- Hotkeys
- Easy export
- Deeplinks
- Easy “processing notes” workflow
- Easy selection and rearrangement of blocks

*`*` Asterisk represents the capabilities Craft does not have. See below for more detail.*

## Nice to haves
- Collaborative features: comments, easy sharing, multiplayer
- Tags *
- Pretty interface and delightful UX

To meet the needs above I rely on [[my digital ecosystem]], with most of my work being handled by a few specialized tools:
- [[Craft is my workspace]]
- [[Things is for getting shit done]]
- [[Drafts is for immediate note capture]]
- [[Obsidian is for building my body of work]] and tending this [[digital garden]]

It's been a fascinating [[evolution of the ecosystem]] and I've learned so much about new tools, including how [[Tools for managing information overload and improving how we think are on the rise]]. 

I do believe [[A knowledge worker’s toolkit needs to be well-rounded]], but tools can also be distracting so it's a fine line to tow. Hopefully I can settle in to my new system and really [[build a body of work]].
