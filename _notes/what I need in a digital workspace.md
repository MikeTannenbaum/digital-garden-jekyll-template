title: what I need in a digital workspace
---
> As of July 2021 [I've joined the team](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-new-career-adventure-addressing-systems-change-our-mike-tannenbaum/) at [The Recycling Partnership](https://recyclingpartnership.org) as their [Director of Organizational Effectiveness](https://linkedin.com/in/tannenbaum). **Everything you read below is out of date** and applies to my life before joining The Partnership. 
> 
> What I'm realizing right now, on Wednesday, August 18, 2021, is that my entire personal [[digital ecosystem]] needs to evolve to meet my new needs. I've been self-employed for ~6 years, working with dozens of teams in dozens of tools, but mostly with my own software stack. Now my personal work is so intertwined with my job's work that I need new ways of working *for myself*. 
> 
> Specifically, I need to design a system for both myself and my team, individually as well as in intertwined. As I onboard myself to my new role, and build situational awareness, I'll consistently iterate and refine both systems until I find what works best.

That said, I'm still thinking about this! This is The Refined Mind, after all—a never-ending work-in-progress [[digital garden]]—so let's go!

I need a space where I can think endlessly and capture what's worthwhile. I also need to be able to send clippings from anything I read: highlights from articles and books, worthwhile tweets, words on the internet I want to capture and queue for review.

## I have two roles to consider
1. Personal work + The Refined Mind
2. The Partnership's Director of Org Effectiveness

**These roles are incredibly intertwined and simultaneously hold both similar and unique needs.**

## Key similarities
1. Both roles are dedicated to designing, implementing, and refining productivity systems
2. I'm fully invested in creating the best possible outcomes in both of my roles because I fully give a shit about my life, my planet, and my communities, and these two roles are now two sides of the same coin
3. I lean on technology as much as possible for capture, recall, and automation

### From a tech perspective, they both need to offer
- Clarity of use
- Speed of interaction
- Extensibility and customization
- Flexible organization and structure
- Connectivity of notes and words
- Excellent mobile experience

## The differences
### Personal productivity unique needs
[[I want somewhere to be My Workspace™]], and I want that somewhere to have what I consider critical capabilities:
- Bidirectional links
- Fast search
- Fast sync
- Seamless mobile experience 
- Private, Secure, Offline
- Daily Notes
- Unlinked references
- Hotkey custom bindings
- Easy export
- Deeplinks
- Easy “processing notes” workflow
- Easy selection and rearrangement of blocks
- Collaborative features: comments, easy sharing, multiplayer

*`*` Asterisk represents the capabilities Craft does not have. See below for more detail.*

### Organizational productivity unique needs
- Transparency
- Alignment
- Sharing and Permission Controls
- Integrations
- Collaboration and Editing

> Somehow, I need to create *one* digital space for *two* roles

To meet the needs above I rely on [[my digital ecosystem]], with most of my work being handled by a few specialized tools:
- [[Craft is my workspace]]
- [[Things is for getting shit done]]
- [[Drafts is for immediate note capture]]
- [[Obsidian is for building my body of work]] and tending this [[digital garden]]

It's been a fascinating [[evolution of the ecosystem]] and I've learned so much about new tools, including how [[Tools for managing information overload and improving how we think are on the rise]]. 

I do believe [[A knowledge worker’s toolkit needs to be well-rounded]], but tools can also be distracting so it's a fine line to tow. Hopefully I can settle in to my new system and really [[build a body of work]].
