Working efficiently means producing the desired results with minimal wasted effort or resources.

In other words, it means knowingâ€¦

-   Where to go to **get the information** you need when you need it
-   How to **make decisions necessary** to move work forward
-   How to effectively **communicate and collaborate** with team members

It also means we ********************************************************************************trust the systems, processes, and people******************************************************************************** with whom we collaborate daily, as the whole team has agreed to work in the same way with the same behaviors.

It looks like you having more time to do the most meaningful work instead of having to chase down information, sit in endless meetings, and feel paralyzed by activity
