title: A starting point for thinking
---
Hi, I’m Mike.

You’ve stumbled into my public workspace. It’s a bit unusual and unlike most sites.

This is where I share my thinking, though [[these notes are written for myself]]. I believe [[Writing is thinking]], and this is my attempt to write and think in public.

It’s a perpetual work in progress and evolves along with my ideas, most of which fall within these [[Writing themes]]. Ideas and words on this site might be wrong, but that’s kind of the point—to challenge existing beliefs in ways that result in growth as a person. In time, I’ll learn. If you can help me get there faster, please comment or write me a letter anytime.

Feel free to explore [[What has my attention now]], my [[web of thinking]], or any of the links that catch your curiosity.

Have something to say? I check [email](mailto:yo@miketannenbaum.com) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/theroyaltbomb) occasionally. Still curious? [My main site](https://miketannenbaum.com) has [essays](https://miketannenbaum.com/writings), [projects](https://miketannenbaum.com/projects), a [newsletter](https://miketannenbaum.com/signup) and more.
