title: how I use digital tools

> Collecting my use cases so that I know for what I'm designing

## Second Brain / Personal Knowledge Management / #PKM / Tools for Thought
### Whatever it's called, here's how I use it:

- Capture thoughts and write ideas
- Capture links to explore later
- File links away for future reference
- Highlight words from around the internet
- Research and create notes full of information and data
- Stash information away for later (terpenes, domain info, disc golf)
- Document notes from meetings (work, boards, intros, volunteering)
- Organize work and manage projects
- Create documents (climate career search, web3)
- Keep logs of my activity (daily notes, server logs, mac logs)
- Digital gardening // iterating on existing notes and ideas
