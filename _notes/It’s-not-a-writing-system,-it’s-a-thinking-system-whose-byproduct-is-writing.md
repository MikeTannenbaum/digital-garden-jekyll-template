title: It’s not a writing system, it’s a thinking system whose byproduct is writing
---
[[Writing is thinking]]. It leads to discovery.

[[Discovery is where the magic happens]], often by accident.

Some of the most innovative and beloved products started as the byproduct of another creation.

In the case of a thinking system, that byproduct is writing, much of which is revisited and tended to regularly.

[[Every time you tend to an idea you create an opportunity to share original work with others]]. You also advance your ideas and improve how you articulate your original thoughts.

[[Share ideas before they’re ready]].
