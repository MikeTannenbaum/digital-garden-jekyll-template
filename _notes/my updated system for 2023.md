title: my updated system for 2023
---

> This is an iterative note that's part of [[my digital ecosystem]] and thus always evolving

While Notion has been my daily driver for the last year+ at work and increasingly at home, it doesn't work as well for the details of daily life operations. There's too much system to setup and not enough intuitive interaction, which makes it too cumbersome in a situation when I need to be highly effective with my time. With two little kids at home (9.5mo and 2.33yr), the work needs to get done as efficiently as possible so that every "spare" moment can be for what *I* need, not what the kids need. In short, Notion requires too much tinkering when I want straightforward.

Which brings me to what this note is about:

> Organizing how essential information flows between my mind and my digital tooling

## Here's where I'm at, as of [[Sunday, November 20th, 2022]]
- Notion is practical
- Obsidian is magical
- Drafts is foundational

# My System for Storing and Accessing Knowledge

### Obsidian — Messy Notebooks
[[Obsidian is for building my body of work]]

- Evergreen notes


### Drafts — Sticky Notes
[[Drafts is for immediate note capture]]

Reminders is for ad hoc things I don't need to see in order to complete — literally, reminders
- Ad hoc reminders
- Location-based reminders
- Timers, things not to forget, etc






# My Process for Keeping Things Organized

## Inboxes are reviewed daily and zeroed out weekly
- **Daily reviews** are to cherrypick the urgent and important items to be prioritized
- **Weekly reviews** are to fully process all inboxes to zero and close all loops
