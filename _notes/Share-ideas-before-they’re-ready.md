title: Share ideas before they’re ready
---
Often we have ideas and then sit on them for a long time, telling ourselves “it’s not ready yet” and therefore we never publish the idea, which is as if we never really had it at all.

Sharing ideas before they’re ready creates opportunities for people to challenge assumptions and meld minds in ways that strengthen the core of an idea.

Quick feedback loops enable iteration and refinement, which result in better ideas.

Since these are thoughts in progress it’s important to note that these are not beliefs nor any representation of one’s values. These are purely ideas evolving in real-time as they progress from fleeting thoughts to useful concepts.

When sharing thoughts in progress] there needs to be an unspoken-yet-mutually-accepted agreement between the reader and writer. Respectful discourse is encouraged but aggression without prior discussion is unwarranted. All words and ideas are subject to change at any time.

One benefit of sharing ideas publicly is the opportunity to collaborate on ideas with people from around the world, which only leads to even more new perspectives to help refine and improve ideas.
